                    <p>Sexual assault and violence has been an issue throughout history and today. For centuries and decades, society
                      looked the other way and encouraged victims to stay quiet about their experiences. However, the <a style="text-decoration: none; color: pink;" src="https://metoomvmt.org/">#MeToo</a> 
                      movement has been on the rise over the recent years, allowing survivors to speak out to highlight the severity of the issue.
