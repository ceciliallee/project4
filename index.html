                    <p>Sexual assault and violence has been an issue throughout history and today. For centuries and decades, society
                      looked the other way and encouraged victims to stay quiet about their experiences. However, the <a class="title" href="https://metoomvmt.org/">#MeToo</a> 
                      movement has been on the rise over the recent years, allowing survivors to speak out to highlight the severity of the issue. This site outlines the progress the movement had on a global scale,
                      with events of public figures and civilians voicing their experiences, to encourage conversation for awareness and prevention.

            <p>Activist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarana_Burke" class="link">Tarana Burke</a> creates the <a class="link" href="https://online.maryville.edu/blog/understanding-the-me-too-movement-a-sexual-harassment-awareness-guide/">"Me Too" </a>movement to help sexual assault victims in underprivileged communities 
              in the United States. By sharing their own experiences, the movement’s proponents make clear just how common sexual harassment is. The hope is that, if people are more aware of sexual harassment and how casually it is sometimes treated, then tolerance for it will decrease and support for victims will rise.</p>

        <p>The <a class="link" href="https://metoomvmt.org/">#MeToo</a> movement has sparked a drastic and empowering impact on those who have stayed silent and also those with recent experiences. 
        Society all over the world, however, must continue to make progress as the social justice system remains broken for sexual assault survivors as well, with less than <a class="link">1%</a> of rapes leading to felony convictions, while at least 
        <a class="link">89%</a> of victims face emtional and physical consequences. We must continue speaking out about this issue and keep fighting to create change, together, as allies and as survivors.

      can get involved.</p>
